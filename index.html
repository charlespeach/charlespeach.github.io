  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I'm a passionate senior full stack Ruby on Rails developer who is friendly, social, determined and focused on delivering real results.</p>
  
  <p>I have been working with Ruby/Rails for over 10 years, originally coming from C#. Working with Ruby is satisfying, fast and I really enjoy the amazing developer community. I was part of the Ruby NZ committee for 3 years, both as a General Committee Member and then onto President of <a href="https://ruby.nz/#past-committee">Ruby NZ</a>.</p>

  <p>Over my career I have been honing my Infrastructure and DevOps skills, originally starting with manual scripting then to Chef/Knife Solo, Ansible, and more recently Docker, kubernetes, and terraform. I have good experience with AWS and some limited experience with Azure and GCP.</p>

  <p>When I am not coding or learning about new development practices and paradigms, I enjoy playing games, am a keen DIYer, car enthusiast, and hobbyist woodworker. Recently I have been into mountain biking which has given me a great outlet for spending time outdoors.</p>
